          <h2>Personal Consultation</h2>
            <p class="txt">
              Personal consultations are exclusively for state and local government employees. A personal consultation is not a full-blown financial plan. I’m able to offer personal consultations for a reasonable price for two reasons.
            </p>
            <p class="txt fix2">
              1) I’ve done hundreds of hours of research on the NC retirement plans and spent thousands of hours counseling state employees about their financial situations at different times in their lives. When you hire me, you get access to all this knowledge.
            </p>
            <p class="txt fix2">
              2) The majority of the work is going to be done by you. I’ve created the to-do lists for the different career stages. I know what information I need in order to offer you objective advice. You will spend anywhere from 1-10 hours tracking down all the items on the to-do list and sending them to me. This will enable me to use my time more efficiently in reviewing the information, developing a plan of attack, and presenting my findings to you.
            </p>
            <h3>Personal Consultation Fees</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>$250 for “New” with 0-5 years experience</li>
              <li>$300 for “In the Trenches”</li>
              <li>$400 for “Nearing Retirement”  </li>
              <li>$400 for “Retired”</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="txt">
              Add $100 if you would like to have an in-depth discussion on student loans and the loan forgiveness programs
            </p>

            <h2 id="fp">Financial Planning</h2>

            <p class="txt">
              Some people will go through the personal consultation and find that they need more in-depth financial planning. This is generally the case with employees who are close to retirement and trying to develop a retirement income plan. I charge $250 an hour for personal financial planning and most plans take anywhere from 10-20 hours depending on complexity. Financial planning is offered to anyone, not just state employees.
            </p>

            <h2 id="wm">Wealth Management</h2>

            <p class="txt">
              I provide professional investment management services for my clients.  I will generally only manage households with over $100,000 of investable assets. I charge an asset under management fee of somewhere between 1.5% and .50% depending on how much you have invested with me.
