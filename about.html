              I spent 10 years advising North Carolina Teachers and State Employees on every aspect of their financial lives. During this time I was saddened to see that many of these middle class people were taken advantage of by financial professionals selling terrible, commission based products. At the end of 2018 I finally decided to do something about it. I walked away from my business that I had spent 10 years building and joined an independent firm that would allow me to charge a fee for financial advice. My goal, to offer affordable fiduciary advice that was not tied to the sale of any product and to help state employees make good financial decisions as they work there way to and through retirement.

            <h2>My Journey</h2>

            <p class="txt">
                I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago. My father and most of my uncles were Chicago Firefighters. Growing up in a firefighting family gives me a unique perspective of what family life is like for city and state employees.
            </p>

            <p class="txt">
              I graduated in 2001 from Western Illinois University. After graduating, I worked for an outdoor adventure company called Wilderness Adventure located outside of Roanoke Virginia. This is where I met my wife Rebecca. After a summer leading backpacking trips in the Blue Ridge mountains, Rebecca and I traveled to the Philippines where we trained to be PADI Divemasters. For the next few years, we lived in the Philippines guiding dive trips during the winter months. During the summer and fall, we would come back to the states and guide diving trips for Wilderness Adventure in Puerto Rico.

            <p class="txt">
              It was tough to pay student loans with pay from guiding dive trips, but Rebecca and I loved to travel. We decided to teach English in Asia as our next adventure. We taught for one year in Taiwan and close to 5 years in South Korea. The last 3 years in South Korea were spent on a tiny island called Namhae. Namhae was amazing. We lived in a German village overlooking the ocean and didn’t have to pay rent. We were able to save a lot of money and pay off student loan debt. All this while the markets and economy were crashing in America in 2008. We seriously considered living as expats forever and I’m pretty sure our parents were okay with that until my daughter was born. Mary-Lois was born in Jinju, South Korea in June of 2009. It was at this point that Rebecca and I decided we had to move back to the states so we could raise Mary-Lois near her grandparents.

              My father-in-law encouraged me to talk with my uncle who owned a Horace Mann agency in Florence, SC. (LPL Financial and Horace Mann are separate entities). Horace Mann is a financial services firm that sells insurance and investments to teachers. Horace Mann liked to hire teachers and there was an opening in the Charlotte area. I interviewed for the job via SKYPE video conferencing and was offered the position. A couple months later, we flew from Namhae to Charlotte with Mary-Lois and soon to be born Wilson and started our new lives.

            <p class="txt">
              It was a big leap of faith moving back to the states. I had never been to Charlotte and didn’t know a single person there. I quickly passed all of my insurance and securities licensing tests and before long, I was standing in front of a group of teachers on the first day of school letting them know I could help them with their insurance and retirement planning needs. I had a few appointments that week and when I was asked questions about the retirement system, I had no clue what was going on. I decided right then and there that I was going to learn the ins and out of the NC teachers and state employees retirement system and learn as much as I could about Financial Planning so I could better serve my clients.

              I started off taking the RICP course offered through the American College. Read more about the RICP designation

            <p class="txt">
              The RICP course gave me a great base in which to build off, but I still felt I needed to learn more so I decided I was going to become a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional. I received 7 large textbooks in the mail and felt completely overwhelmed. How was I going to go through all this material while raising two children under 5? Two years later I passed the exam and earned the CFP® marks. Read what it means to be a CFP®

              I truly enjoyed my time owning my Horace Mann business but in order to offer financial planning for a fee, I had to join an independent firm. LPL Financial is one of the largest independent broker dealers in the country and the support they give their advisors is unmatched in the industry. I’m looking forward to the next chapter of my journey and hope you join me along the way.
