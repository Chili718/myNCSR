            <div class="fix2">

            <p class="txt"><i>Saving for retirement</i></p>

            <p class="txt">Every dollar counts when saving for retirement early in your career. Allocating your retirement dollars wisely at a young age, can have a huge impact on your life 30 years down the line. There are many types of retirement accounts you can contribute to such as an IRA, 403b, 457b, or 401k. You also need to decide between pre-tax or Roth contributions and choose how to invest the money you are saving. Hire me and I will explain the options available to you and help you choose the most appropriate account for your situation.
            </p>

            <p class="txt"><i>Student Loans</i></p>

            <p class="txt">Low wages combined with large student loan balances are the reality for many new teachers and state employees. It’s important to understand and take advantage of the student loan forgiveness programs early on. Hire me and I will help you understand and navigate the world of student loan forgiveness.
            </p>

            <p class="txt">The $250 -$350 dollars you spend on a consultation with me could be worth thousands of dollars over your lifetime and get you moving in the right direction. It could also help to correct costly mistakes you’ve already made that you don’t even realize.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h2 id="itt">In The Trenches</h2>

            <p class="txt">
              In the trenches is a pretty broad category. Some of you are about to get married and start a family while some of you may have children who are about to graduate college. After consulting with me you will have a better idea of when you’ll be able to retire, what kind of retirement account you should be investing in and how the money should be invested. I’ll also include an insurance review to make sure you are properly covered and not over or under insured.  If student loans are still an issue for you I can help you review your options for an additional charge.
            </p>

              <i>Saving for Retirement</i>
            </p>
            <p class="txt">
              When you first started working for the state you may have enrolled in a retirement account. Was it a 403b, 401k, 457b, Roth 403b, Roth 401k, IRA? What were the investment options? Review what you have now because it’s not too late to fix a bad decision you may not even know you made.
            </p>
            <p class="txt">
              Should you be contributing to a pre-tax account or is a Roth better? It all depends on your taxable income and if you believe tax rates are going to go up or down in the future. Your salary may not seem like much but if your spouse earns a high income it may be beneficial for you to max out a pre-tax retirement account. State employees can max out both a 403b or 401k and a 457b enabling them to tax defer $38,000 a year and almost $50,000 a year if they are over 50 and use the catch-up provision.
            </p>
            <p class="txt">
              <i>Insurance</i>
            </p>
            <p class="txt">
              Do you understand the life insurance that the state provides you as a state employee? Do you know what the county offers you? Did you enroll in any group life? Would you be better off getting personal life insurance?
            </p>
            <p class="txt">
              Do you have the right auto and home insurance coverage? Should you shop it or are you better off staying with the same company.
            </p>
            <p class="txt">
              <i>Beneficiaries</i>
            </p>
            <p class="txt">
              Are all your beneficiaries up to date. A lot of times an employee will get married or go through a divorce and not update all of the beneficiaries for their accounts. The last thing you want is for an ex-spouse to be the beneficiary of one of your accounts.
            </p>
            <p class="txt">
              <i>Saving for College</i>
            </p>
            <p class="txt">
              What’s the best way to save for college for your children? Generally a 529 plan is a great way to save. North Carolina used to give you a state tax break when you used the NC College Foundation 529 but the state took that tax break away a few years ago. It’s still a pretty good plan.

            </p>
            <p class="txt">
              I get it. Twenty-seven children in a class. Kids can be rude and obnoxious but sometimes parents can be worse. Paperwork, testing, social media. It’s not easy being a teacher today. However, the most valuable part of your pension is the years of service you accrue working for the state. You need to commit to 30 years. If you can’t then the sooner you leave the better so you can start earning more in the private sector and building up that 401k.

            <p class="txt"><i>
              Contributions to a traditional 401(k), 403(b) or IRA may be tax deductible in the contribution year, with current income tax due at withdrawal. Withdrawals prior to age 59 ½ may result in a 10% IRS penalty tax in addition to current income tax. The Roth 401(k), 403(b) and IRA offer tax deferral on any earnings in the account. Withdrawals from the account may be tax free, as long as they are considered qualified. Limitations and restrictions may apply. Withdrawals prior to age 59 ½ or prior to the account being opened for 5 years, whichever is later, may result in a 10% IRS penalty tax. Future tax laws can change at any time and may impact the benefits of Roth 401(k), 403(b) and IRAs. Their tax treatment may change. Contributions to a 457(b) plan may be tax deductible in the contribution year. Distributions are taxed at withdrawal, unless rolled into a new employer’s plan or an IRA within 60 days of the distribution. A mandatory 20% federal withholding tax applies directly to distributions taken that could be eligible for rollover. Prior to investing in a 529 Plan investors should consider whether the investor’s or designated beneficiary’s home state offers any state tax or other state benefits such as financial aid, scholarship funds, and protection from creditors that are only available for investments in such state’s qualified tuition program. Withdrawals used for qualified expenses are federally tax free. Tax treatment at the state level may vary. Please consult with your tax advisor before investing. For information about specific insurance needs or situations, contact your insurance professional. Tax and legal services are not offered by Harbor Financial Group, LPL Financial or affiliated advisors. We suggest that you discuss your specific situation with a qualified tax or legal advisor.

You will have a very close estimate of how much your gross pension will be and how much you can expect to net after health insurance and taxes are taken out. I will also help you choose the most appropriate retirement option based on your personal situation. For an additional fee I will walk you through the retirement process and help you fill out all of the paperwork when the time comes. This is an important time in your life and for those of you who can afford it I would tell you to seriously consider going through the financial planning process.

            <p class="txt">
              You’ve almost made it to your full retirement with the state. This picture is very different for everyone. I’ve seen people with 30 years of service retire at age 49. I’ve seen people with 5 years of service retire at age 65. The one thing you all have in common is the need for a retirement income plan. How are you going to create reliable income that will last for you and your spouse’s lifetime?

              Over the course of your working life you’ve probably accumulated multiple retirement accounts. Now is the time to take control and figure out exactly what you have and how it fits into your retirement income plan. How will distributions from the account effect your taxes? How is the money invested? How much risk are you taking? Is a roth conversion strategy right for you?

              <i>Annuities</i>
            </p>

            <p class="txt">
              Your pension with the state is very much like an immediate annuity that you can purchase in the private sector. However, the pension with the state is much more generous than a private sector annuity. I see many state employees being sold complex annuity products that guarantee them a certain amount of fixed income at some point in the future when in reality they already have that from the state. Annuities can be very easy to understand but they can also be quite complex. If you have an annuity or are considering purchasing one it’s important to talk to a fiduciary who can help you figure out what kind of annuity, how it can help and if you even need it in your portfolio.
            </p>
            </div>

            <p class="txt">
              Annuities are long-term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Gains from tax-deferred investments are taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal. Guarantees are based on the claims paying ability of the issuing company. Withdrawals made prior to age 59 ½ are subject to a 10% IRS penalty tax and surrender charges may apply. Traditional IRA account owners should consider the tax ramifications, age and income restrictions in regards to executing a conversion from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. The converted amount is generally subject to income taxation. For information about specific insurance needs or situations, contact your insurance professional.
