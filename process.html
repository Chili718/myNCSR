          <h1>Our Process</h1>

            <p class="txt">Congratulations! You’ve already made it to the first step which is researching a way to get independent advice about your current situation or retirement. The next step is to stop procrastinating and face your financial reality, good or bad. The sooner you figure out where you are, the sooner you can make a plan to get where you want to go.</p>
            <p class="txt">If you are considering hiring Bob, contact us and let us know what career stage you are in as a state employee. New, In the Trenches, Nearing Retirement or Retired.</p>
            <p class="txt">We will email you a client agreement and disclosure documents so you know exactly what to expect from your personal consultation and how much it will cost.</p>
            <p class="txt">If you wish to move forward with the personal consultation you will send us the signed client agreement along with full payment for the consultation.</p>
            <p class="txt">Once we receive the signed agreement we will email you a list of things you need to do to prepare for the consultation. These include filling out a net-worth worksheet, setting up your Orbit account, providing us with retirement account statements, etc. It could take anywhere from 1 to 10 hours to complete these tasks. The more thorough you are the more tailored my advice can be.</p>
            <p class="txt">Once I receive all of the information I will review the documentation and call you if I have questions. I will then do an in-depth analysis and come up with my personal recommendations for your specific circumstances. The personal consultation will take place over the phone or at my office in Cramerton.</p>
